The objective of this project is to comprehensively analyze and evaluate the quality of life in countries worldwide by examining a wide range of features. 
Our aim is to identify the factors that contribute to different quality of life values across countries and develop a regression-based machine learning model 
that can predict quality of life values for unknown countries based on their known features.

To achieve this, we have utilized Python and several powerful libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, Folium, and matplotlib. 
These libraries provide us with the necessary tools to effectively analyze the data, build the machine learning model, and visualize the results.

In our analysis, we explore various features that impact quality of life, ranging from economic indicators to social factors. 
By examining the relationships between these features and quality of life values, we can gain insights into the factors that contribute to a 
higher or lower quality of life in different countries.

By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically regression-based models, we can develop a predictive model that accurately estimates quality 
of life values for countries where such data is not readily available. This enables us to assess the quality of life in those countries and make informed 
comparisons and assessments across different regions of the world.

Our project has been implemented on Kaggle, providing a platform for collaboration and sharing of the code and analysis. This ensures transparency and encourages 
further research and improvement in the field of quality of life analysis.

Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the worldwide state of quality of life, empowering policymakers, researchers, and individuals 
with valuable insights to drive positive change and enhance the well-being of people across the globe.
